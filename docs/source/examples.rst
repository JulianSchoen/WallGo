Collected examples
======================================

Here we collect a number of different example model files. The Yukawa model file is self-contained, but to save repeated code over the different examples, we have written an example base code, which the specific models utilise.

The examples files can be found below. They can also be found at the `WallGo GitHub repo <https://github.com/Wall-Go/WallGo/tree/main/Models>`_ together with pre-computed
collision integrals.
