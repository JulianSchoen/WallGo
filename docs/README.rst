To make the html version of the docs, one first needs to install the list of
requirements. From the root directory of the repository, run::

    cd docs
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Then, make the html version of the docs with::

    make html

These are then installed under::

    docs/_build/html

Look for the index.html file to start with.
