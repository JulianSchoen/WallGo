    """Model definitions must be filled in to a ModelDefinition helper struct.
    This has two main parts:
    1) Model parameter definitions which must contain all model-specific symbols that appear in matrix elements. This must include any particle masses that appear in propagators.
    2) List of all particle species that appear as external legs in collision processes. If ultrarelativistic approximations are NOT used for some particle species,
    the particle definition must contain a function that computes the particle mass from model parameters. This must be defined even if you include mass variables in the model parameters in stage 1).
    Details of both stages are described in detail below.

    """Specify symbolic variables that are present in matrix elements, and their initial values.
    This typically includes at least coupling constants of the theory, but often also masses of fields that appear in internal propagators.
    Depending on your model setup, the propagator masses may or may not match with "particle" masses used elsewhere in WallGo.

    In this example the symbols needed by matrix elements are:
    gs -- QCD coupling
    msq[0] -- Mass of a fermion propagator (thermal part only, so no distinction between quark types)
    msq[1] -- Mass of a gluon propagator.

    Thermal masses depend on the QCD coupling, however the model definition always needs a numerical value for each symbol.
    This adds some complexity to the model setup, and therefore we do the symbol definitions in stages: 
    1) Define independent couplings
    2) Define helper functions for computing thermal masses from the couplings
    3) Define the mass symbols using initial values computed from the helpers.

    For purposes of the model at hand this approach is overly complicated because the mass expressions are very simple.
    However the helper functions are necessary in more general cases if using non-ultrarelativistic particle content.
    In this example the mass functions are written explicitly to demonstrate how the model setup would work in more complicated models.
